Release notes for 2.14
======================

* gtkitemfactory.h is now completely deprecated.
  As gtkactiongroup.h and gtkstock.h no longer include the gtkitemfactory.h
  header, this might break application using gtk_item_factory_* symbols
  without including gtkitemfactory.h - even though this behaviour has never
  been supported in the first place.

* The GtkFileSystem semi-private interface has been removed.
  The GTK+ filechooser implementation now uses GIO directly, which has
  rendered external filesystem implementations unnecessary. Consequently,
  the GtkFileSystem interface is no longer available, nor the filechooser
  will load any GtkFileSystem implementation.

* GtkComboBox now renders the popdown button insensitive when
  the model is empty. Applications which want to populate the list
  only before displaying it can set gtk_combo_box_set_button_sensitivity
  to GTK_SENSITIVITY_ON, so that the button is always sensitive or
  GTK_SENSITIVITY_OFF to make it insensitive respectively.

* GtkAdjustment now enforces that values are restricted to the
  range [lower, upper - page_size]. This has always been the documented
  behaviour, and the recommended practice is to set page_size to 0
  when using adjustments for simple scalar values, like in a slider
  or spin button. 

* gdk-pixbuf will use GIO for mime type detection if possible. For
  this to work, shared-mime-info needs to be installed and XDG_DATA_DIRS
  set accordingly at configure time. Otherwise, gdk-pixbuf falls
  back to its built-in sniffing implementation.


How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system.
(http://bugzilla.gnome.org, product gtk+.) You will need to create an
account for yourself.
  
In the bug report please include:
  
* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - What version of X
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

  If you can reproduce it with one of the tests or demos built with GTK+, 
  such as demos/gtk-demo/gtk-demo, that would be most convenient. Otherwise, 
  please include a short test program that exhibits the behavior. As a 
  last resort, you can also provide a pointer to a larger piece of software 
  that can be downloaded.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the
  crash occured.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but is not
  necessary. If you do send a stack trace, and the error is an X error,
  it will be more useful if the stacktrace is produced running the test
  program with the --sync command line option.


Patches
=======

Patches should also be submitted to bugzilla.gnome.org. If the patch
fixes an existing bug, add the patch as an attachment to that bug
report.

Otherwise, enter a new bug report that describes the patch, and attach
the patch to that bug report.

Bug reports containing patches should include the PATCH keyword in their
keyword fields. If the patch adds to or changes the GTK+ programming
interface, the API keyword should also be included.
  
Patches should be in unified diff form. (The -u option to GNU diff.)
