<mclasen>	ok, so I guess we should start by collection agenda items
 *	mclasen first goes for a coffee
<mclasen>	are any rtl speakers present ?
<tml>	you mean writers ;-)
<mclasen>	readers, actually...
<mclasen>	...apparently not
<mclasen>	One question I wanted to discuss today is how gtk-2-6 looks, bugwise
<mathrick>	mclasen: if you wanted RTL, you'd need to set some more friendly time of meeting
<mathrick>	all the arabic world is asleep atm
<mclasen>	what about israel ?
<mathrick>	mclasen: similar
<mathrick>	they're all GMT+5,+6
<mclasen>	well, its not that important, I can probably debug it myself
<tml>	israel is only gmt+2, afaik
<mclasen>	i discovered a serious rtl issue yesterday, and wanted to check if it has been noticed by anybody else: #165210
<tml>	and morocco is +1 or even +0. plus there are lots of hebrew and arabc speakers in the us, too. but i digress...
<mclasen>	gmt: it must suck to have that nick when discussion timezones...:-)
<mathrick>	heh
<mclasen>	federico: do you have a plan to fix the file duplication bug ?
<mclasen>	different topic: we have a bug about making the message dialog spacing hig-conform. 
<mclasen>	apparently we already do that for the file chooser, so our dialog spacings could be a bit messed up currently
<federico>	mclasen: yeah, I'm on it. At some point Alex changed the vfs backend do that mandatory reload of the directory... I don't think it's needed
<federico>	(plus the bits in the file chooser entry; it should really not reuse the folder object)
<mclasen>	so from looking at testgtk, it seems that currently the file chooser uses hig dialog spacing and all other complex dialogs use the default dialog spacing
<federico>	didn't garnacho have a patch to fix that as well?
<federico>	or am I getting confused with the rest of his GtkMessageDialog patch?
<mclasen>	I don't recall spacing being discussed at all in the past. I guess the question is if we can and want to change anything there, and if yes, then what mechanism is the best one
<owen>	mclasen: IMO, changing the defaults for GtkMessageDialog should be OK, changing it for standard dialogs definitely OK. 
<owen>	Changing padding for GtkDialog is dubious, because people might pack boxes or whatever to get the desired spacing
<mclasen>	so you would agree with a patch which does the same thing the file chooser does in all complex dialogs ?
<owen>	mclasen: Yes.
<mclasen>	good, I'll update the bug to invite an all-spacing-fixing patch
<garnacho>	hmm, federico, I remember I doubted in changing the spacing, I don't remember if I actually did it... :/
<federico>	what if we fix *all* spacings?  people who have code to make them HIG-compliant may appreciate being able to remove that code
<vektor>	Sounds dangerous.
<mclasen>	federico: what other spacings do you have in mind ?
Jan 25 16:35:14 *	garnacho sees 12 pixels spacing between GtkMessageDialog elements
<mathrick>	federico: but until they do so, won't their layout break spectacularly?
<federico>	mclasen: gtkdialog border width?
 *	federico checks
<owen>	federico: Changing gtkdialog I think is very dubious. See above
<mclasen>	I think we repeatedly argued against changing gtkdialog in the past
<federico>	probably we should do it, run the desktop for a bit, and see if things look too bad
<federico>	... then have a flag day if they do
<federico>	things will have to get changed when we switch to font-based spacing
<mclasen>	that bug is on the 3.0 milestone...:-)
<mclasen>	can I invite people to use our new pool milestones ? I have been trying to move incoming bugs to the appropriate milestones as I have time, but we're already accumulating 30+ bugs on --- again
<vektor>	I noticed that bugs I filed against gtktreeview aren't on milestones, are they supposed to be?
<mclasen>	once somebody looks at them and decides where to put them, yes
<vektor>	OK.
<mclasen>	ok, I've got to go, see you next week
<federico>	speaking of spacings
<federico>	would it be reasonable to zero the space between a scrolled window's scrollbars and the content area?
<owen>	federico It's a style property
