How to report bugs in GTK+

<P>
(The following is taken from the <A HREF="/faq/">FAQ</A>.)
</P><P>
Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system (<A HREF="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">http://bugzilla.gnome.org</A>). You will need to enter your email address and receive a password before you can use the system to register a new bug report.
</P><P>
There are a number of options to select and boxes to fill in when submitting a bug report. Please remember that the more information you give, the easier it will be to track the problem down. Extra information that may prove useful includes:
<P>
<I>How to reproduce the bug.</I>
</P>
<UL>
<P>
If you can reproduce it with the testgtk program that is built in the gtk/ subdirectory, that will be most convenient. Otherwise, please include a short test program that exhibits the behavior. As a last resort, you can also provide a pointer to a larger piece of software that can be downloaded.
</P><P>
(Bugs that can be reproduced within the GIMP are almost as good as bugs that can be reproduced in testgtk. If you are reporting a bug found with the GIMP, please include the version number of the GIMP you are using)
</P><P>
</UL>
<P>
<I>If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the crash occurred.</I>
</P><P>
<I>Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but are not necessary.</I> 
<UL>
If you do send a stack trace, and the error is an X error, it will be more useful if the stacktrace is produced running the test program with the --sync command line option.
