Introduction

<P>
GTK+ is an Open Source<sup>1</sup> 
Free Software<sup>2</sup> GUI Toolkit.
Everything about GTK+ from the object-oriented design to the Free Software 
LGPL licensing allows you to code your project with the most 
freedom possible.  You can develop open software, free software, or
even commercial non-free software without having to spend a dime for 
licenses or royalties.
</P>
<P>
By distributing GTK+ under the LGPL, we allow you to take the code, 
modify it however you wish: including basing your custom widget off
of our code without distributing our entire distribution.  All you
have to do is keep the code free for others to use.
</P>
<P>
This freedom extends to more than just licensing.  The desktop today is 
filled with many different look and feel environments.  
We don't think you should settle for just one.  GTK+ has themes, and so you 
can have them all.  Check out the GTK+ screenshots at the leading Theme 
Website, <A HREF="http://themes.org/gtk/cgi-bin/gto.cgi?gallery">themes.org</A>.
The best part is you can write your own themes!
</P>
<P>
With GTK+, you aren't tied down to one programming language either,
even though GTK+ is written in C.  Programmers have contributed many 
language bindings for GTK+ such as C++, Guile, Perl, Python, TOM, Ada95, 
Free Pascal, Eiffel, and a few other languages.  Now all your programs
can look and feel the same because no matter what you write them in 
they can all use GTK+.  There is no need to use a complicated and
specialized preprocessor for your C++ code either, making it easier to 
write standard C++ code with GTK+.
And if you are trying to make them integrate
into a system with some things written in a legacy toolkit, you can
use themes to make GTK+ integrate cleanly.  That is the kind of flexibility
you should expect out of your GUI Toolkit.
</P>
<P>
The flexibility doesn't stop there.  GTK+ has a powerful signal system,
many different widget layout techniques, and a lot of widgets.  You can 
derive a new widget from an existing widget, and combine widgets to form 
complex composite widgets. 
</P>
<P>
While GTK+ was developed for the X Window System, there is already work
underway to port GTK+ to Windows-based systems.  Thus, GTK+ will,
in the future, be a viable way to create applications which work
on both UNIX-based systems and Windows systems.
</P>
<P>
Development tools exist which you can use to speed development using GTK+.  
For example, there are user interface layout tools that can generate
code for GTK+ such as <A HREF="http://glade.gnome.org/">Glade</A>.
</P>
<P>
Lastly, GTK+ has been tried and tested.  GTK+ is used by the GIMP,
the GNOME project, and a lot of applications.  An open software
model has produced all of this flexibility and will ensure GTK+'s 
future.
