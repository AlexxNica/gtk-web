GTK+ Success Stories
<!--#include file="section_end.html"-->

    <p>
      GTK+, the development toolkit for the GNOME desktop and the GIMP
      image editor, is the choice of thousands of developers
      worldwide.  Developers choose GTK+ for a variety of reasons,
      from the community that surrounds it to the free-of-charge LGPL
      licensing it offers. For many, the internationalization support
      seals the deal; for others, performance is the most important
      factor.  Some prefer it because they program in C, and others
      because they program in C++, or Python, or C#. Regardless of the
      reasons, GTK+ is the finest Unix/Linux development toolkit
      worldwide. This page presents some of the developers who use
      GTK+ and the reasons they like it.

      <a href="http://touchtunes.com">TouchTunes Music Corporation</a>
      sells over a thousand digital jukeboxes a year, each with a GTK+
      interface and glib-driven internals.  Developer Tristan Van
      Berkom writes that he prefers GTK+ because "I consider myself a
      perfectionist" and that, examining the source, he often says "I
      couldn't have done it better myself."

    <p> Andrew Makeev, from Solvo, Ltd. of St. Petersburg, Russia,
    develops warehouse management systems using C++ and gtkmm.  He
    cites several factors in his company's choice of GTK+ as a
    development toolkit, especially performance and
    internationalization. He appreciates the extensive documentation,
    direct access to the development community, and the
    straightforward object model.

    <p>
      Richard Warren, a senior software engineer for <a
      href="http://www.primagraphics.com">Primagraphics</a>, says
    GTK+ has let him ship products "on the customer's choice of
    platform, be it Linux, Solaris or even Windows, with a virtually
    identical application in each case and very little additional
    engineering effort on our part."
    </p>
   
    <p>
	  He also has kind words for the Gtk+ community: "The quality of
      the libraries and the advice, responsiveness and direct access
      to the developers available through the mailing lists meant that
      we have never once regretted" choosing Gtk+ as a development
      platform.

     Miguel Pignatelli, a senior scientist at the Bilbao, Spain
    bioinformatics company <a href="http://www.noraybio.com">NorayBio</a>,
    uses GTK+ in the development of software that predicts protein
    folding patterns. Although they initially selected GTK+ because
    they were writing in C, the NorayBio developers have grown to
    appreciate the way that provides access to both high and low
    levels of graphical programming and inter-process communications.

    <p>
      The <a href="http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/">National
    Gallery</a> uses GTK+ for its image-processing system,
   	<a href="http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">VIPS</a>. VIPS is in
    use on Windows and Linux systems as part of the <a
    href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~km/projs/vasari/">Vasari</a> image
    archiving project, cataloging and storing extremely
	high resolution digital images of artwork for museums
    worldwide. Developer John Cupitt says that the Gallery's reasons
    for choosing GTK+ were portability, support, and appearance.

    <p>
      Developers at <a
      href="http://sendoutcards.com">SendOutCards.com</a> use GTK+ and
    gtkmm to develop internal applications that allow end users to
    perform specialized technical tasks easily. Developer Adam Olsen
    says he selected GTK+ for its licensing and its cross-platform
    portability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional features he appreciates are the ease of development:
      with libglade, he says, "I really like that I can tweak the
      interface without having to recompile."

    <div class="textbox_header">Audio: <a href="http://linuxaudiosystems.com">Linux Audio Systems</a></div>
	<div class="textbox_content">
    <p>
      <a href="http://linuxaudiosystems.com">Linux Audio Systems</a>, 
      a small music and pro-audio software company, uses GTK+ for all
      of its GUI-based software.  Linux Audio Systems programs in C++,
      and was attracted by the way that the gtkmm wrappers use
      standard C++ and the Standard Template Library. They also
      appreciate the availability of a model/view/controller structure in GTK+.
    </p>
    <p>
      The canvas, in particular, has been
      crucial in their work, and has been extended for the main GUI
      object in the Ardour digital audio workstation. Developer Paul
      Davis says "the ease of new widget creation with gtkmm and the
      simplicity of creating new Canvas items have been highlights for
      us." In addition, "the presence of a very helpful and knowledgeable user
      community on the GTK+ mailing lists has been another very useful
      'feature' of the toolkit for us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, GTK+ offered a better cost structure: the choice of
      the LGPL means that Linux Audio Systems has no licensing fees to
      pay for the toolkit.

    <p>
      Roger Leigh, a developer at the UK company EPIC Technology, uses
      GTK+ and gtkmm to develop point of sale systems. He says "I had
      no problem persuading my boss to use it, since so many high
      quality applications have been written with it."  Leigh
      particularly appreciates the GObject object system, the
      separation of functionality into distinct libraries, the 
      emphasis on standards, and the integration with the C++ Standard
      Library.
    </p>
    <p>
      GUI design in GTK+ is excellent, he says: "I tried out
      Java/Swing a while back, and it didn't even come close to GTK+
      in terms of ease of interface design using Glade."

      University of Ljubljana, is using GTK+ in his work on <a
      href="http://www.fiz.uni-lj.si/phoebe"> eclipse
      patterns in binary star systems.</a> He chose GTK+ for its

	<div class="textbox_header">Industry: BMA Coal, Australia</div>
	<div class="textbox_content">
    <p>
      Kim Adil, at BMA Coal in Australia, used Gtk+ to build a
      cross-platform mining process visualization tool for the mine
      control room.  Developed on Linux and deployed on Windows 2000,
      the application displays near-real-time equipment location and
      status for the mine's heavy equipment. It has been so successful
      that it runs not only in the control room, but on a plasma
      display at the entrance to the BMA office.
    </p>
    <p>
      BMA Coal selected Gtk+ for its licensing, cross-platform
      ability, and range of features. Adil, a mechanical engineer by
      with little previous software development experience, says
      "cross platform stability has been quite astounding," and that
      the Gtk+ community and mailing lists were significant factors in
      the project's success.
