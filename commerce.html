	<h2>Developers</h2>
	<p>GTK+, the development toolkit for the GNOME desktop and the
	  GIMP image editor, is the choice of thousands of developers
	  worldwide. Developers choose GTK+ for a variety of reasons, from
	  the community that surrounds it to the free-of-charge LGPL
	  licensing it offers. For many, the internationalization support
	  is essential; for others, performance is the most important
	  factor. Some prefer it because they program in C, and others
	  because they program in C++, or Python, or C#. Regardless of the
	  reasons, GTK+ is the finest development toolkit worldwide. This
	  page presents some of the developers who use GTK+ and the
	  reasons they like it.</p>  
	
	<h2>Platforms</h2>
	<h3><a href="http://www.gnome.org"><img src="images/gnome-logo.png" alt="GNOME"/></a></h3>
	
	<p>The GNOME platform has been developed for over 10 years now
	  and is used by many people expecting the high grade, clean look
	  and feel for their every day desktop. GNOME delivers that with
	  the power of GTK+ sitting underneath the software stack written
	  on top of it.</p>
	
	<h3><a href="http://www.maemo.org"><img src="images/commerce/platforms/maemo.png" alt=""/></a></h3>
	
	<p>The Maemo platform has been developed for over 2 years now
	  and is the basis for Nokia's N770 and N800 products which have
	  been highly successful.</p>
	
	<h2>Applications</h2>
	
	<h3>TouchTunes Music</h3>
	<p><a href="http://touchtunes.com/">TouchTunes Music</a>
	  Corporation sells over a thousand digital jukeboxes a year, each with a GTK+ interface and glib-driven internals. Developer Tristan Van Berkom writes that he prefers GTK+ because <q>I consider myself a perfectionist</q> and that, examining the source, he often says <q>I couldn't have done it better myself</q>.</p>
	
	<h3>Solvo Ltd</h3>
	<p>Andrew Makeev, from Solvo, Ltd. of St. Petersburg, Russia,
	  develops warehouse management systems using C++ and gtkmm. He
	  cites several factors in his company's choice of GTK+ as a
	  development toolkit, especially performance and
	  internationalization. He appreciates the extensive
	  documentation, direct access to the development community, and
	  the straightforward object model.</p>

	<h3>Primagraphics</h3>
	<p>Richard Warren, a senior software engineer
	  for <a href="http://www.primagraphics.com/">Primagraphics</a>,
	  says GTK+ has let him ship products <q>on the customer's
	  choice of platform, be it Linux, Solaris or even Windows,
	  with a virtually identical application in each case and very
	  little additional engineering effort on our part</q>. He
	  also has kind words for the GTK+ community: <q>The quality
	  of the libraries and the advice, responsiveness and direct
	  access to the developers available through the mailing lists
	  meant that we have never once regretted</q> choosing GTK+ as
	  a development platform.</p>

	<h3>NorayBio</h3>
	<p>Miguel Pignatelli, a senior scientist at the Bilbao, Spain
	  bioinformatics
	  company <a href="http://www.noraybio.com/">NorayBio</a>, uses
	  GTK+ in the development of software that predicts protein
	  folding patterns. Although they initially selected GTK+
	  because they were writing in C, the NorayBio developers have
	  grown to appreciate the way that provides access to both
	  high and low levels of graphical programming and
	  inter-process communications.</p>
      
	<h3>London National Gallery</h3>
	<p>The <a href="http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/">London
	  National Gallery</a> uses GTK+ for its image-processing
	  system, <a href="http://www.vips.ecs.soton.ac.uk/">VIPS</a>.
	  VIPS is in use on Windows and Linux systems as part of
	  the <a href="http://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~km/projs/vasari/">Vasari</a>

	  image archiving project, cataloging and storing extremely
	  high resolution digital images of art work for museums
	  worldwide. Developer John Cupitt says that the Gallery's
	  reasons for choosing GTK+ were portability, support, and
	  appearance.</p>

	<h3>SendOutCards</h3>
	  <p>Developers
	  at <a href="http://sendoutcards.com/">sendoutcards.com</a> 
	  use GTK+ and gtkmm to develop internal applications that
	  allow end users to perform specialized technical tasks
	  easily. Developer Adam Olsen says he selected GTK+ for its
	  licensing and its cross-platform portability. Additional
	  features he appreciates are the ease of development: with
	  libglade, he says, <q>I really like that I can tweak the
	  interface without having to recompile</q>.</p>

	<h3>Linux Audio Systems</h3>
	  <p><a href="http://linuxaudiosystems.com/">Linux Audio
	  Systems</a>, a small music and pro-audio software company,
	  uses GTK+ for all of its GUI-based software. Linux Audio
	  Systems programs in C++, and was attracted by the way that
	  the gtkmm wrappers use standard C++ and the Standard
	  Template Library. They also appreciate the availability of a
	  model/view/controller structure in GTK+. The canvas, in
	  particular, has been crucial in their work, and has been
	  extended for the main GUI object in the Ardour digital audio 
	  workstation. Developer Paul Davis says <q>the ease of new
	  widget creation with gtkmm and the simplicity of creating
	  new Canvas items have been highlights for us</q>. In
	  addition, <q>the presence of a very helpful and
	  knowledgeable user community on the GTK+ mailing lists has
	  been another very useful feature of the toolkit for
	  us</q>. Finally, GTK+ offered a better cost structure: the
	  choice of the LGPL means that Linux Audio Systems has no
	  licensing fees to pay for the toolkit.</p>

	<h3>EPIC Technology</h3>
	  <p>Roger Leigh, a developer at the UK company EPIC Technology,
	  uses GTK+ and gtkmm to develop point of sale systems. He says
	  <q>I had no problem persuading my boss to use it, since so
	  many high quality applications have been written with
	  it</q>. Leigh particularly appreciates the GObject object
	  system, the separation of functionality into distinct libraries,
	  the emphasis on standards, and the integration with the C++
	  Standard Library. GUI design in GTK+ is excellent, he
	  says: <q>I tried out Java/Swing a while back, and it didn't
	  even come close to GTK+ in terms of ease of interface design
	  using Glade</q>.</p>

	<h3>University of Ljubljana</h3>
	  <p>Andrej Prsa, research scientist in the Physics department at
	  the University of Ljubljana, is using GTK+ in his work on
	  <a href="http://www.fiz.uni-lj.si/phoebe">eclipse patterns
	  in binary star systems</a>. He chose GTK+ for its licensing
	  and because of the ubiquity of Linux software in
	  astrophysics.</p>

	<h3>BMA Coal, Australia</h3>

	  <p>Kim Adil, at BMA Coal in Australia, used GTK+ to build a
	  cross-platform mining process visualization tool for the mine
	  control room. Developed on Linux and deployed on Windows 2000,
	  the application displays near-real-time equipment location and
	  status for the mine's heavy equipment. It has been so
	  successful that it runs not only in the control room, but on a
	  plasma display at the entrance to the BMA office. BMA Coal
	  selected GTK+ for its licensing, cross-platform ability, and
	  range of features. Adil, a mechanical engineer by with
	  little previous software development experience,
	  says <q>cross platform stability has been quite
	  astounding,</q> and that the GTK+ community and mailing
	  lists were significant factors in the project's success.</p>
