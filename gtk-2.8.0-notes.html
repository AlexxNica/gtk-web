<pre>GTK+ 2.8 Specific Notes
=======================

* GTK+ 2.8 and Pango 1.10 require the cairo library.

* The default theme has been renamed to "Raleigh". Existing configurations
  specifying the "Default" theme name should still work.

* The GtkTreeView::enable-search property has been changed to control
  only typeahead search, not the C-f keybinding to start an interactive 
  search. To turn off interactive searching completely, you have to
  set GtkTreeView::search-column to -1.

* The restriction on using the same cell renderer in multiple columns 
  of a GtkTreeView is now more strictly enforced.

* In GTK+ 2.8, GtkCalendar uses nl_langinfo() (if available) to determine 
  the first day of the week. Thus, it is possible to select the first day
  of the week independently from the language, by setting LC_TIME.

* In GTK+ 2.8, the gtk-update-icon-cache utility includes image data
  in the icon caches, which will make the icon cache files larger than
  the one produced by GTK+ 2.6. This change will reduce the memory 
  overhead of icon themes at runtime, since all GTK+ applications can
  share the image data in memory.

* In 2.8, GDK emits GdkEventGrabBroken events when a keyboard or pointer
  grab is broken. On X11, this can happen if the same application grabs 
  again, or if the window used for the grab becomes unviewable. It happens
  more often on Win32. Applications which use grabs should pay attention 
  to these events and do the necessary cleanups when the grab is lost.

* The GIOChannel code for sockets on win32 has been rewritten. 
  Applications who make non-trivial use of GIOChannels on win32 should 
  be watched for possible problems.
 
* GLib 2.8 uses atomic operations to implement reference counting, thus 
  g_object_ref/unref, g_closure_ref/sink/unref and g_iochannel_ref/unref
  can be used without locking in multithreaded applications. Note that 
  other modifications, like concurrent setting of properties still require 
  locking.

* g_convert() and related character set conversion functions have been 
  fixed to emit pending shift states and to not cache iconv descriptors 
  across multiple calls, since that is problematic for some encodings. 
  Note that these functions are not suitable for streaming conversions; 
  use g_iconv() to do streaming conversion.
