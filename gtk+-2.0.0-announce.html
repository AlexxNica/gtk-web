What is GTK+
============

GTK+ is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user
interfaces. Offering a complete set of widgets, GTK+ is suitable for
projects ranging from small one-off tools to complete application
suites.

GTK+ has been designed from the ground up to support a range of
languages, not only C/C++. Using GTK+ from languages such as Perl and
Python (especially in combination with the Glade GUI builder) provides
an effective method of rapid application development.

Earlier versions of GTK+ have been used in a wide variety of
applications, including the GNOME desktop and the GNU Image
Manipulation Program (GIMP). Version 2.0 of GTK+ offers the same
flexibility that made GTK+-1.0 and GTK+-1.2 so popular, and adds a
much enhanced feature set, increased ease of programming for
application developers, and ease of use for end users.

GTK+ is free software and part of the GNU Project. However, the
licensing terms for GTK+, the GNU LGPL, allow it to be used by all
developers, including those developing proprietary software, without
any license fees or royalties. GTK+ is the only 100% free-of-cost open
source industrial-strength GUI toolkit available today.

GTK+ 2.0 is the foundation of the GNOME 2.0 desktop, to be released
later this year. GTK+ 2.0 will be available in standard installations
of Solaris, Linux, and HP-UX.

What's new in GTK+-2.0
======================

The huge feature set of GTK+ 2.0 more than doubles the size of GTK+
1.2, moving from 230,000 lines of code to 620,000 lines of code.  Over
the last three years a line of code was added to GTK+ every 5
minutes. Nonetheless a statically-linked version of gtk-demo can still
fit on a 1.4M floppy disk.

Much of the new code for GTK+ 2.0 appears in the base libraries such
as Pango. Nonetheless the changes to GTK+ itself are extensive.

gdk-pixbuf:

 The gdk-pixbuf (GDK pixel buffer) library for image loading and
 manipulation is now integrated into GTK+. gdk-pixbuf supports fast
 MMX-accelerated image scaling. Enhancements over the standalone
 gdk-pixbuf include support for animated images, more image formats,
 greater robustness/error-handling, and saving images to files.

GDK:

 Enhancements to the GDK library, which is the interface between
 the GTK+ widgets and the underlying windowing system include:

  * Previews of ports to Microsoft Windows and direct frame buffer display.
    (A final version of the Windows port is expected within a month or two.)

  * Support for a full 32-bit coordinate space; GDK handles emulation
    of this coordinate space on systems with smaller coordinate spaces
    such as X11 and Win32.

  * Double buffering and redraw regions are tracked at the windowing
    system level, allowing applications to achieve efficient and
    flicker-free drawing with very little effort.

  * Support for anti-aliased fonts and alpha-composited images via the
    RENDER extension to X.

  * Use of the GObject system for GDK objects, facilitating language
     bindings, improving consistency, and allowing derivation of new
     GdkDrawable types.

  * Extension of GdkRGB to handle all visuals and colormaps,
    eliminating the need to manually allocate colors.

  * Support for rendering text using the Pango infrastructure.

  * Support for new standards at <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/">http://www.freedesktop.org/</a>

New widgets and widget improvements:

  * GtkTextView - this new Text widget is based on the Tk text widget,
    and inherits an efficient implementation and a complete set of
    options for styled text.  The Tk base was extended with multiple
    views of a single buffer, pixel-based scrolling, and the full range
    of internationalization capabilities provided by Pango.

  * GtkTreeView - a flexible widget for tree and list display, with
    features such as a model-view split for abstracting data storage
    from display, the ability to create custom models to accommodate
    large data sets, versatile display/rendering features, and 
    editable data cells.

  * An overhauled GtkDialog and new GtkMessageDialog for convenient 
    dialog handling.

  * A GtkImage widget for images and animations.

  * GtkProgressBar API revised and made easier to use.

  * GtkSpinButton API simplified.

  * GtkOptionMenu API simplified.

  * GtkLabel supports styled text and selectable text.

  * GtkEntry supports internationalization.

  * GtkSeparatorMenuItem!

Other enhancements:

  * Complete support for Unicode and internationalized text via Pango,
    throughout all GTK+ widgets. Capable of processing text in all
    major world scripts, including European languages, Chinese,
    Korean, Japanese, Hebrew, Arabic, Thai, Tamil, Devanagari.

  * GtkClipboard object makes it easy to handle cut-and-paste.

  * Right-click popup menus for cut/copy/paste, Unicode character 
    insertion, input method selection, and so on.

  * Rewritten user interfaces for color selector and font 
    selector.

  * Many widgets no longer have an associated GdkWindow, further 
    reducing flicker/tearing and allowing themes with translucent  
    buttons and similar effects.

  * Extensive keyboard navigation support, including simplified "just
    works" APIs for adding mnemonics and accelerators.

  * A clean and attractive new default appearance.

  * Many other usability improvements.

  * A new input method framework that provides a simple and consistent 
    interface on top of different backends. On-the-spot input is now
    provided when using GTK+ with input method servers based on XIM.

  * A system for stock toolbar/menu/button images.  Themes
    can include replacement icons as part of the theme.

  * Much enhanced API documentation included with GTK+.

  * Systematically simplified and enhanced the API based on thousands
    of user requests and questions fielded by the GTK+ team, resulting 
    in many hundreds of small API tweaks and additions too detailed to
    list here.
