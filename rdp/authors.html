<H2>GTK+ 2.0 Development</H2>
<P>
In GTK+ 2.0.x the reference documentation has been integrated with the GLib
and GTK+ packages (i.e. in the glib, gtk+ and pango modules in GNOME's CVS
repository). The GTK+ developers have finally realized the importance of
documentation and now the rule is that no new code is allowed to go into
GTK+ without inline documentation for all of the functions. Great!
<P>
However, there are still many parts of GTK+ and GLib with little or no
documentation. Hopefully we will soon devise a procedure for non-developers
to help out by submitting documentation for these parts. Watch this space!

<H2>Is there a mailing list?</H2>
Yes. Please subscribe to it if you want to help with the documentation.
<p>
To subscribe send a message to
<a href="mailto:gtk-doc-list-request@redhat.com">gtk-doc-list-request@redhat.com</a>
with "subscribe" as the Subject.

<H2>What tools do I need?</H2>
You can write the documentation using any ASCII text editor if you wish,
but if you want to generate the HTML output yourself, you will need the
following tools:
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="http://www.jclark.com/jade">Jade v1.1</A> - this is a DSSSL
processor to convert SGML to various formats.
<BR><BR>

<LI><A HREF="http://nwalsh.com/docbook/dsssl">DocBook Modular Stylesheets
v1.19+</A>
- these stylesheets are used together with Jade to convert DocBook SGML to
HTML (and other formats).
<BR><BR>

<LI><A HREF="http://www.ora.com/davenport">The DocBook DTD v3.0</A> - the
SGML definition of the DocBook syntax.
</UL>

Most Linux distributions now include the above packages so the easiest
way to get set up is to install the packages for your distribution.

<P>
Since setting up Jade can be a problem, I've also created a package of all
the SGML DTDs and entities needed,
<font color="#F08080"><B>gtk-doc-extra</B></FONT>, available on the
<A HREF="download.html">download</A> page. This includes the DocBook DTD.

<P>
You then need to grab the two documentation packages
(<font color="#F08080"><B>glib-reference</B></FONT> &amp;
<font color="#F08080"><B>gtk-reference</B></FONT>), and the
<font color="#F08080"><B>gtk-doc</B></FONT> package if you want to build the
HTML.

<BR><BR><BR>
<H2>How do I write the documentation?</H2>
<P>
You edit the 'template' files in the 'tmpl' subdirectories. Each file
corresponds to one section of the documentation.
<P>
The author.txt file in the gtk-doc/doc directory contains some notes for
authors. You should also look at some of the documentation which has already
been written (e.g. several of the GLib pages).
<P>
You may want to reorder the functions/macros etc. within your section.
To do that edit the glib-sections.txt file (or gdk/gtk-sections.txt).
<P>
You can also group functions/macros by using &lt;SUBSECTION&gt; tags. These
result in blank lines in the synopsis section of the HTML output, making it
easier to read.

<BR><BR><BR>
<H2>How do I rebuild the HTML?</H2>
<P>
You need the tools described above. You then 'cd' to the directory above
the template files and run
'<font color="#F08080"><B>make sgml</B></FONT>'
to build the SGML and
'<font color="#F08080"><B>make html</B></FONT>'
to turn the SGML into HTML. (This can take around 15 minutes for GTK.)
<P>
Note: You should probably not use 'make templates', especially if you do not
have the latest CVS version of GTK installed, as it re-scans all the header
files and changes the template files.

<BR><BR><BR>
<H2>How do I submit my documentation?</H2>
<P>
Email your template pages to 
<A HREF="mailto:damon@ximian.com">damon@ximian.com</A>
gzipped, or in a tarball, or as a plain ASCII message or attachment.
If you have reordered the functions in your pages, make sure you send me
the part of the gXXX-sections.txt file as well.
