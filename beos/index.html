GTK+ for BeOS
<!--#include file="section_end.html"-->

<P>
The GTK+ port to BeOS is in alpha stage right now.  That means
it crashes a lot, but starting to look nice and work quite well.
</P>
<P>
The initial port of GTK+ for BeOS is was done by Shawn T. Amundson 
and James Mitchell.  This port came about because we needed the GDK
drawing routines to work for our native interface port of GIMP.  
What better way to test GDK drawing routines than by porting
the rest of GTK+?  The port proved very useful in our work
on GIMP because we can now run GIMP without an X Server, much
like the <A HREF="http://www.gimp.org/win32/">win32 port</A>.
</P>
<P>
Shawn and James are no longer working on a native interface port of
GIMP to BeOS, and have little time for stabalizing the port of GTK+,
so therefore have put up the lastest GTK+ sources so others can use 
them as a basis for a more stable port.  One such attempt is being 
done at <A HREF="http://www.beunited.org/">BeUnited</A>.  We wish such 
a project much luck.

<B>Status</B>

<P>
Stuff is working, although still at an alpha stage.  Crashes are common.
Menus work now, drawing is mostly correct, images work, pixmaps work, etc. 
Lots of stuff todo, see below.

<P><B>Todo</B></p>
<P>
The list of remaining bugs is huge.  We have found so far though that
implementing one more function can squash a large number of them all
at once.  Here are some known issues and/or todo items:
</P>

<B>This list is out of date, the newer version implements some things
that are listed here.  Also, things like <A HREF="http://www.pango.org/">Pango</A>
must now be ported.</B>


<UL>
<LI>key events are completely unimplemented
<LI>pointer grabbing only half-way implemented
<LI>testgtk/clist (Add 1,000 Rows With Pixmaps) clears out controls at top of window
<LI>testgtk/clist various drawing bugs with clist clearing/scrolling
<LI>testgtk/color selection dragging on current color (below gamut) crashes with
                        window unref
<LI>gdk_image's with "None" color have no transparency implementation
cursors are completely unimplemented
<LI>notebook tabs don't redraw correctly. Possibly a window_show window_hide problem
<LI>menu off by one error drawing menubutton bottom
<LI>testgtk/label underlining broken
<LI>testgtk/panes redraw bug in dragging panes
<LI>option menus let you select once and then you are screwed
<LI>testgtk/scrolled window off by 1 error
<LI>testgtk/selection off by 1 error on redraw on deselect
<LI>examples/clist scrollbar redraw bug after add list
<LI>examples/entry garbage wWWWWw characters when un-visible
<LI>lowcolor not set for certain font cases. Anti-aliasing looks like crap
<LI>menu pulldown after window has been moved to another workspace jumps to origworkspace
<LI>gimp toolbox options widget problems. Seems similar to notebook problem
</UL>

The <B>alpha</B> version has been released (source only) and is 
available for interested <B>developers</B> to look at.  We suspect
it will not be easy to build on other systems without all our 
GNU tools installed, and we are working on that.

<P><B>Building</B></P>
<P>
We still need to integrate our work into the main GTK+ distribution,
in order to make it easier for others to build.  Since we haven't done
that yet, the snapshots are just our CVS tree with the CVS directories
removed.  So you have to have some GNU tools installed like automake
and autoconf.
</P>
<P>
You can build it on BeOS (once you have another other stuff installed)
by using the 'BUILD.BeOS' shell script included.  Note this is a one-liner
and you don't have to use it.  It is what we use.  Make sure it gets
installed in the same place as GLib, for sanity's sake.
</P>
<P>
You should use the latest CVS version of GLib, which you have to install
before installing GTK+.  Look at the <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org/devel/whatiscvs.shtml">GNOME CVS Instructions</A> for details in obtaining glib from CVS.
</P>
<P>
Some versions of software we are running on BeOS:

<UL>
<LI>Automake version 1.4a
<LI>Autoconf version 2.14.1
<LI>Libtool version 1.3a (CVS Version, HACKED)
</UL>

Unfortunately I can't remember if these are from CVS or a tar file.  Find
the latest and greatest and if that doesn't work tell us.  You shouldn't
need libtool to be up-to-date unless you type libtoolize.  We will test 
this stuff on a clean system soon and fixup these instructions a bit.

If you want to contribute, get on the gtk-devel-list mailing list.  That 
is the appropriate place for patches and other development discussion.
