<matthias>	who are we missing ? sweden, denmark, mexico...
<owen>	andersca is on vacation, jrb is on vacation
<gmorten>	I can mumble some bad jokes in Danish, if needed.
<matthias>	federico is fooderico...
<matthias>	don't know whats up with ssp, but I guess we should start anyway...
<matthias>	ok, so according to the schedule, the 2.5.2 release in about two weeks should be almost api frozen. 
<owen>	How are we doing on testing on the major additions ... in particular iconview?
<matthias>	owen: I don't think the icon view has seen real testing yet. anders added a demo to gtk-demo, and James used it for his icon picker proposal, thats about it...
<owen>	matthias: Ugh. I hate to finalize without any testing
<matthias>	owen: would you expect the testing to reveal api issues ?
<owen>	matthias: Well, yes, that would be the hope...
<owen>	Probably some good review would also be to the point (I haven't gotten around to reviewing the API yet, myself, really should) but that only goes so far
<matthias>	owen: but isn't the point of declaring the api frozen well before the 2.6 release to give others a chance to test the new api before it gets released
<matthias>	?
<owen>	matthias: We can declare the API "we think it is pretty much done", or "slushy frozen" but declaring it frozen sort of makes the testing pointless
<matthias>	owen: thats basically how I interpreted api freeze milestones so far: "we think we're done - barring any errors or oversights"
<matthias>	owen: of course, that doesn't mean that testing the new stuff before the api freeze is a bad idea...
<owen>	matthias: Hmm, I guess there is some difference in my mind with "done with API freeze milestone" and "API frozen"
<matthias>	owen: If you think it helps, I can see to get a testiconview into gtk+/tests which would let you test various settings and their combinations...
<owen>	matthias: The question isn't "how does it look" but "will it fit applications needs"
<matthias>	owen: that question is best answered by application programmers...
<owen>	matthias: Yes, I don't think we can declare GTK+-2.6 API frozen until we get some such feedfback
<matthias>	owen: EggIconList is used in a number of apps...
<owen>	That's certainly a good sign
<matthias>	Maybe we can get some of those apps to review the icon view api. I can ask around.
<garnacho>	sorry, can I ask about the GtkMessageDialog API change I proposed?
<garnacho>	IMHO it could be worth adding something like this for 2.5.x/2.6
<matthias>	garnacho: I think so. But I'm not convinced of deprecating the existing message dialog constructors.
<garnacho>	matthias: they may not be deprecated, I thought about deprecating them because we can get the same with the new functions
<owen>	garnacho: I think if you wrote the impleentation, what the set of constructors should be would be a detail that could be sorted out
<garnacho>	yes
<garnacho>	maybe :)
<matthias>	garnacho: does your implementation map the current message dialog text to primary or to secondary ?
<garnacho>	secondary, the primary is left to title text
<matthias>	garnacho: so, in your implementation gtk_message_dialog_set_secondary_markup() is doing the same as gtk_message_dialog_set_markup() ?
<garnacho>	yes
<garnacho>	maybe the constructors do something different (the GtkButtonsType stuff), but that function is virtually the same
<matthias>	garnacho: have you considered going with set_markup() / set_title_markup(), etc instead of primary/secondary, and save one redundant function ?
<garnacho>	oh, that could be a nice solution
<garnacho>	I used the primary and secondary words for coherence with the hig
<garnacho>	but it's ok with me
<garnacho>	I'll cook a new proposal with this suggestion
<matthias>	garnacho: That would be nice. Please keep the set_extra_widget() as a separate proposal.
<garnacho>	ok
