<P>
<B>General Notes</B>
<UL>
	      <P>
		GTK+ uses so-called "Linux kernel" numbering, where
		odd numbered series like 1.3.x and 2.1.x are unstable
		development versions, and even numbered series like
		2.0.x and 2.2.x are stable maintenance branches.
		It is not expected that we will break either source
		or binary compatibility before GTK+-3.0
	      </P>
	      <P>
		GTK+ development is discussed on
		<a href="/mailinglists.html">gtk-devel-list@gnome.org</a>.
		We use the <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org">bugzilla</a>
		bug tracker to keep track of particular issues; there
		is a milestone for each future release, as well as a
		'future' milestone, for things not yet assigned to a
		definite milestone. (The components of interest for
		GTK+ development are 'gtk+', 'glib', 'pango' and
		'atk')

              <P>
	       Recently, we've also started to do weekly  team meetings on IRC.
	       The meetings were initiated to discuss and organize the 2.4 
	       release, but maybe we'll keep them afterwards. The logs of
	       previous meetings are available <a href="/plan/meetings/">here</a>.

<B>Particular releases</B>
	    <UL>
	      <P><B>2.2</B> &ndash; GTK+-2.2.0 was released Dec 20, 2002. The
		rest of the 2.2.x series will be maintenance releases.
	      </P>
	      <P><a href="/plan/2.4/"><B>2.4</B></a> &ndash; GTK+-2.4
		was released Mar 16, 2004 with features such as a
		better file selector and a replacement "combo box"
		widget. The rest of the 2.4.x series will be
		maintenance releases.
	      </P>
	      <P><a href="/plan/2.6/"><B>2.6</B></a> &ndash; GTK+-2.6
                is planned for December 2004, and will likely include
                features such as commandline argument parsing in GLib,
                rotated text in Pango, an icon list widget and a progress
                cell renderer.
	      </P>
	      <P><a href="/plan/2.8/"><B>2.8</B></a> &ndash; GTK+-2.8
                will hopefully appear around the middle of 2005. 
	      </P>
	      <P><B>3.0</B> &ndash; A 3.0 release would be the
		earliest point at which we would make a source and
		binary incompatible release. (If and when we do such a
		release, there will be support for parallel
		compilation and runtime environments, as there are for
		GTK+-1.2 and GTK+-2.x.)
