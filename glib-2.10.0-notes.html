<pre>Notes about GLib 2.10
=====================

* The functions g_snprintf() and g_vsnprintf() have been removed from
  the gprintf.h header, since they are already declared in glib.h. This
  doesn't break documented use of gprintf.h, but people have been known
  to include gprintf.h without including glib.h.

* The Unicode support has been updated to Unicode 4.1. This adds several
  new members to the GUnicodeBreakType enumeration.

* The support for Solaris threads has been retired. Solaris has provided 
  POSIX threads for long enough now to have them available on every 
  Solaris platform. 

* 'make check' has been changed to validate translations by calling 
  msgfmt with the -c option. As a result, it may fail on systems with 
  older gettext implementations (GNU gettext < 0.14.1, or Solaris gettext). 
  'make check' will also fail on systems where the C compiler does not
  support ELF visibility attributes.

* The GMemChunk API has been deprecated in favour of a new 'slice 
  allocator'. See the g_slice documentation for more details. 

* A new type, GInitiallyUnowned, has been introduced, which is
  intended to serve as a common implementation of the 'floating reference'
  concept that is e.g. used by GtkObject. Note that changing the
  inheritance hierarchy of a type can cause problems for language
  bindings and other code which needs to work closely with the type
  system. Therefore, switching to GInitiallyUnowned should be done
  carefully. g_object_compat_control() has been added to GLib 2.8.5
  to help with the transition.
