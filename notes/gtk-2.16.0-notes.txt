Release notes for 2.16
======================

* Password entries now display a caps-lock warning. This can be turned off
  with the caps-lock-warning property.

* Various orientation-related functions have been deprecated in favour
  of the new GtkOrientable interface: gtk_scale_button_get_orientation,
  gtk_scale_button_set_orientation, gtk_toolbar_set_orientation.

* The action-proxy interaction has been changed. Widgets that operate as
  proxies have to implement the GtkActivatable interface now. GtkActivatable
  implementation are responsible for syncing their appearance with the
  action and for activating the action. All GTK+ widgets that are commonly
  used as proxies implement the GtkActivatable interface.

* The handling of keyboard shortcuts has been changed, to help with a
  longstanding complaint about the way GTK+ handles multiple layouts. GTK+
  now only uses keys from groups other than the current group if they are
  not present in the current group.
