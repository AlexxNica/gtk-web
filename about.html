About gtk.org<!--#include file="section_end.html"-->

<p>
This site grew into existance when Shawn T. Amundson (still the current
maintainer of the site), posted his GTK+ FAQ onto his personal GTK+ web
page.  After Shawn help organize the creation of www.gimp.org, the 
gtk.org domain was registered and his webpage evolved into what you 
see now.  The site is hosted by XCF at Berkeley.

<p>
We now have a few others helping with the site too.  Several of the 
gimp.org webmasters help maintain the GIMP ftp mirror information, which is 
the same one for gtk.org.  Tony Gale maintains the on-line tutorial
information.  Damon Chaplin maintains the RDP project and it's associated 
web pages.  And, scoop over at freshmeat.net has been extremely helpful 
in providing GTK+-specific freshmeat news for our site.

GTK+ should be asked on the appropriate mailings lists.
