<mclasen>	ok, so I guess the topic for today is getting 2.8 out of the door
<mclasen>	I did a glib 2.7.5 release earlier today, that I announced as a release candidate for 2.8
<mclasen>	so far, two issues have appeared; atomic operations seem to not work as intended on s390/s390x, and the g_iconv changes I did today seem to break gnome-terminal
<mclasen>	I also started doing a gtk 2.7.5 build, but I doubt that I can finish that today
<mclasen>	there are some small open questions which I have for gtk 2.8
<mclasen>	the first is related to theme names
<mclasen>	I have renamed the default theme to "Raleigh" now
<mclasen>	and that made me wonder if we want to rename the default key theme as well, to get rid of "Default" as a name there as well
<mclasen>	possible names I came up with are "GTK+" or "Boston"...
<owen>	mclasen: I think that's fine.
<owen>	mclasne: Default, that is
<mclasen>	owen: keep "Default", you mean ?
<jrb>	mclasen: how about 'Westford'
<owen>	mclasen: to me there is clearly a default key theme, unlike appearance. We haven't had any distros wanting to override it
<owen>	"emacs" versus "westford" ... hmm
<mclasen>	"GTK+" might be a more reasonable alternative 
<mclasen>	but its not a big deal, keeping "Default" there is fine with me
<mclasen>	the other open question I had was regarding bug 311787
<mclasen>	I discussed it with owen earlier, and initially thought it would be wrong to replace GDK_CURRENT_TIME with the user interaction time in gdk_window_focus
<mclasen>	but I think elijah argues convincingly in that bug, and the EWMH seems to be clear that the timestamp of _NET_ACTIVATE_WINDOW is supposed to be the user time
<owen>	mclasen: What about the case of focusing windows without user interaction? Wasn't there supposed to be some way of indicating that?
<mclasen>	owen: in the spec, you mean ?
<owen>	mclasen: In the spec, or in existing practice
<mclasen>	the spec doesn't mention that case, afaics
<mclasen>	in practise I would expect most people to pass 0 if they don't have a timestamp at hand...
<owen>	mclasen: I know there was a huge discussion on gnome about how to get an app to not pop below other windows
<mclasen>	ok, I guess this means it is an item for more discussion with elijah then, not one to rush into 2.8 at this point
<mclasen>	anything else we should discuss ?
<mclasen>	ah, yes. I asked wingo about the gstreamer threadsafety requirements 
<mclasen>	He wasn't entirely clear, but he put his knowledge into a comment in the atomic refcounting bug
<mclasen>	it appears that gstreamer would like to be able to use the same object concurrently from multiple threads, which is more than glib normally guarantees
<mclasen>	seb128: the infinite loop in g_convert should be fixed
<seb128>	mclasen: thanks, that fixes the issue :) (BTW: my surname is Sebastien with a "e")
<owen>	seb128: surname? I thought your surname was Bacher
 *	jrb did too
<seb128>	owen: grumpf, no, that's my english sucking
 *	mclasen hopes he fixed the right name
<seb128>	mclasen: yeah, thanks
<seb128>	I meant first name 
<seb128>	mclasen: anyway the name fix is right and the patch works fine, thanks :)
<owen>	seb128: surname is a little artificial in English too, most people say first-name, last-name, except people who deal with Asian names a lot
<seb128>	ok
<owen>	seb128: But sorry about any mispellings of Sebastien ...  Sebastian Wilhelmi was a big contributor for a long time
<seb128>	no problem, I don't really care ... that's just weird to read it with a "a" :)
<mclasen>	its the german spelling, so it looked quite natural to me
<seb128>	(to be correct it should be "Sébastien" but I don't use the "é" usually because of encoding issues you get with non-ascii chars)
<seb128>	(that's better now but some time ago the Debian pages used to mess utf-8 chars, etc)
<owen>	seb128: I think GNOME bugzilla still has problems. But the GTK+ ChangeLog is definitely UTF-8 these days
<GTKool_2kx>	surname is "nom de famille", sébastien (:-))
<seb128>	GTKool_2kx: I've figured :)
<GTKool_2kx>	seb128: ok, so let's go
<seb128>	thanks anyway :)
<GTKool_2kx>	I've seen today on a post that GNOME 2.12 will be release in earlier september with GTK+ 2.8, is this correct ? tml will you release a such version for Windows on this date ?
<GTKool_2kx>	.. (released) in ..
