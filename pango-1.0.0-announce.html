<title>GTK+ - The GIMP Toolkit</title>

<pre>Pango-1.0.0 is now available for download at:

 <a href="ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.0/">ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.0/</a>

Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout
is needed; however, most of the work on Pango-1.0 was done using the
GTK+ widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text
and font handling for GTK+-2.0.

Pango is designed to be modular; the core Pango layout can be used
with four different font backends:

 - Core X windowing system fonts
 - Client-side fonts on X using the Xft library
 - Direct rendering of scalable fonts using the FreeType library
 - Native fonts on Microsoft backends

Dynamically loaded modules then handle text layout for particular
combinations of script and font backend. Pango-1.0.0 ships with a wide
selection of modules, including modules for Hebrew, Arabic, Hangul, 
Thai, and a number of Indic scripts. Virtually all of the world's major 
scripts are supported.

As well as the low level layout rendering routines, Pango includes
PangoLayout, a high level driver for laying out entire blocks of text,
and routines to assist in editing internationalized text.

More information about Pango is available from <a href="http://www.pango.org/">http://www.pango.org/</a>.

Pango depends on version 2.0.0 of the GLib library; more information
about GLib can be found at <a href="http://www.gtk.org/">http://www.gtk.org/</a>.
