Introduction
<!--#include file="section_end.html"-->

<P>
GTK+ is a multi-platform toolkit for creating graphical user
interfaces. Offering a complete set of widgets, GTK+ is suitable for
projects ranging from small one-off projects to complete application
suites.
</P>
<p>
GTK+ is free software and part of the GNU Project. However, the
licensing terms for GTK+, the GNU LGPL, allow it to be used by all
developers, including those developing proprietary software, without
any license fees or royalties.
</p>

<P>
GTK+ is based on three libraries developed by the GTK+ team:
</P>

<ul>
<li><b>GLib</b> is the low-level core library that forms the basis of GTK+ and
   GNOME. It provides data structure handling for C, portability
   wrappers, and interfaces for such runtime functionality as an event
   loop, threads, dynamic loading, and an object system.</li>
 
<li><b>Pango</b> is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an 
   emphasis on internationalization. It forms the core of
   text and font handling for GTK+-2.0.</li>

<li>The <b>ATK</b> library provides a set of interfaces for accessibility.
   By supporting the ATK interfaces, an application or toolkit can
   be used with such tools as screen readers, magnifiers,
   and alternative input devices.</li>
</ul>

<p>
GTK+ has been designed from the ground up to support a range of
languages, not only C/C++. Using GTK+ from languages such as Perl and
Python (especially in combination with the Glade GUI builder) provides
an effective method of rapid application development.

Origins
<!--#include file="boxr_middle.html"-->
GTK+ was initially developed for and used by the <A HREF="http://www.gimp.org">
GIMP</A>, the GNU Image Manipulation Program.  Therefore, it is named "The GIMP
Toolkit", so that the origins of the project are remembered.  Today GTK+
is used by a large number of applications, and is the toolkit used
by the GNU project's <A HREF="http://www.gnome.org"> GNOME</A> desktop.
