<H2>What is it?</H2>
<P>
  GTK+ is already a very stable, powerful, and flexible toolkit.
  The greatest lack at the current time is good reference
  documentation.
<P>
 The GTK+ Reference Documentation Project (RDP) aims to
  provide a complete set of reference material 
  for the GLib, GDK, and GTK+ libraries.

<BR><BR><BR>

<H2>What will be the format of the documentation?</H2>
<P>
  The reference documentation uses the DocBook SGML format.
<P>
  It is created using the gtk-doc system, which parses C header files and
  creates 'template' files which are then filled in by the authors.
  These template files are then converted into DocBook SGML, and from there
  to HTML or printed output.
<P>
  In GTK+ 2.0, the preferred method for documenting functions is to use
  specially-formatted comment blocks within the source code, which gtk-doc
  then parses and inserts into the DocBook output. This is quite similar
  to the javadoc tool for documenting Java code, and is also the preferred
  method of documenting GNOME libraries and applications.

<BR><BR><BR>

<H2>What will be the license of the documentation?</H2>
<P>
  Although the final details of the license have not
  been finalized, it will have essentially the same
  provisions as the following:

<H2>What provisions are being made for copyright?</H2>
<P>
  Contributors to the RDP retain copyright of their 
  contributions. We will keep records of what portions
  of the RDP have been written by what contributors
  in case a future publisher of the work needs additional 
  paperwork. By submitting work to the RDP, contributors 
  agree that their work can be distributed under the above 
  license.
<P>
  You should make sure that you actually have rights
  to the material you submit. For this reason, you should
  not copy text from other material (such as the GTK+
  tutorial). If there is a possibility that your work
  would be owned by your employer, you should get 
  their permission. In such a case, a written disclaimer
  from them might be a good idea. Please contact us if you 
  need help making such arrangements.

<H2>How do I contribute?</H2>
<P>
For GTK+ 2.0.x, the documentation is integrated with the source code and
developers are now encouraged to include inline documentation with their code.
So our old method of working independantly on the documentation can no
longer be used.
<P>
Hopefully we will soon devise a new procedure for non-developers to submit
documentation for the parts of GTK+ that remain undocumented. Watch this space!

<!--
<P>
Have a look at the <A HREF="status.html">status</A> page to see which
sections have not already been taken. Then mail 
<A HREF="mailto:damon@ximian.com">damon@ximian.com</A>
with a list of sections you are willing to write.
<P>
  We'll divide up the work to avoid duplication of
  effort, and get back to you with an "assignment".
