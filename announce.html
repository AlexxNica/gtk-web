The GTK+ development team is pleased to announce the release of

</P>
<P>
GTK+ is a multi-platform open source GUI Toolkit. Everything about
GTK+ from the object-oriented design to the Free Software LGPL
licensing allows you to code your project with the most freedom
possible. You can develop open software, free software, or even
commercial non-free software without having to spend a dime for
licenses or royalties.
</P>
<p>
GTK+ is a set of libraries to create graphical user interfaces. It
works on many Unix-like platforms, and a Windows version is in
development. GTK+ is released under the GNU Library General Public
License (GNU LGPL), which allows for flexible licensing of client
applications. GTK+ has a C-based object-oriented architecture that
allows for maximum flexibility.  Bindings for other languages have
been written, including C++, Objective-C, Guile/Scheme, Perl, Python,
TOM, Ada95, Free Pascal, and Eiffel.
</p>
<p>
GTK+ consists of the following component libraries:
<ul>
<li>GLib. Provides many useful data types, macros, type conversions,
    string utilities and a lexical scanner. Includes Win32 support.
<li>GDK. A wrapper for low-level windowing functions.
<li>GTK. An advanced widget set.
</ul>
</p>
<p>
New and improved features in version 1.2 include:
<ul>
<li>Theme support. Dynamically change the appearance of your GTK+
      applications.
<li>Thread support. Including POSIX threads, Solaris threads and
      experimental NSPR threads support.
<li>New Drag and Drop (DND) support. Both the XDND and Motif protocols
      are supported, and the programmer is presented with a single,
      unified interface.
<li>Runtime loading of dynamic modules.
<li>300 Page Tutorial.
<li>Internationalization of standard dialogs.
<li>Wide character support for text widgets.
<li>New widgets:
<ul>
<li>new multi-column Tree widget
<li>font selection dialog
<li>plug/socket widgets for inter-application embedding
<li>calendar widget
<li>item factory
</ul>
<li>Enhanced functionality to many GTK+ 1.0 widgets
</ul>
</p>
<p>
GTK+ is already being used in many major projects, such as the GIMP
and GNOME projects. Don't get left out!
