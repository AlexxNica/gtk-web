<P>
There are six GTK+ mailing lists.  
</P>
<P><B>gtk-list@gnome.org</B></P>
<UL>
<P>
This is the main mailing list, and 
probably the one you should ask questions about GTK+.  The topic
of this list is general topics related to GTK+, including everything
from discussion of proposed new features to questions about
compiling GTK+.

</P>
</UL>

<P><B>gtk-app-devel-list@gnome.org</B></P>
<UL>
<P>
Discussion on this list is
oriented toward developing applications with GTK+.  This has been
a lower traffic list which is good for asking simple GTK+ questions.

</UL>

<P><B>gtk-devel-list@gnome.org</B></P>
<UL>
<P>
This list is for developers of GTK+
to discuss code.  General GTK+ questions should not be asked on this list,
as that is more appropriate for gtk-app-devel-list. Bug reports
reports and requests for new features should generally be entered in
<a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org">bugzilla</a> instead of sent to this list.

<P><B>gtk-doc-list@gnome.org</B></P>
<UL>
<P>
This list is for discussion of the development of the gtk-doc
documentation tool. Questions about how to use GTK+ belong on
gtk-app-devel-list. Discussion about improving the GTK+ documentation
belongs on gtk-devel-list. Specific suggestions for the documentation
should be put in <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org">bugzilla</a>.

and localization of GTK+ itself and of GTK+ applications or visit the

List Rules and FAQS
<!--#include file="section_end.html"-->
<P><B>Do I have to be subscribed to post?</B></P>
<UL>    
<P>
	Posts from non-members are held for approval by the list
	moderator. This can take several days, so while subscribing
	is not strictly required, it is recommended. (It also reduces
	the burden on the list moderators.)
</P>	
</UL>      
<P><B>How do I unsubscribe?</B></P>
<UL>    
<P>
	Go to the <a href="http://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/">list
	information page</a> for the list in question, enter your
	email address in the text field at the very bottom, and 
	click on "Edit Options". On the next page you'll find
	information about how to unsubscribe, and about how to get
	your password mailed to you.
</P>	
</UL>      
<P><B>What's the difference between gtk-list and gtk-app-devel-list?</B></P>
<UL>
<P>
	gtk-app-devel-list is specifically about writing programs using
	GTK+. Questions about programming with GTK+ should there. All
	other subjects, such as questions about compiling or using
	GTK+ should go to gtk-list.
</P>
</UL>
<P><B>What's the difference between gtk-devel-list and gtk-app-devel-list?</B></P>
<UL>
<P>
	gtk-devel-list is about the development of GTK+
	itself and not about how to develop applications with GTK+.
	Unless your mail is about changes to the GTK+ code or API,
	it should go to gtk-app-devel-list.
</P>
</UL>
<P><B>I found a bug in GTK+. What mailing list should I send it	to?</B></P>
<UL>
<P>
	Many people who think they found a bug in GTK+ actually have
	found a bug in their code. For that reason, the best way to
	proceed is frequently to send mail to gtk-app-devel-list list
	with a <em>short</em>, <em>compilable</em> example describing
	the problem you are having and what you are trying to achieve.
</P>
<p>
	Detailed instructions about bug reporting can be found in the
	README file that comes with GTK+. The main point is that bugs
	should be entered into <a
	  href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org">bugzilla</a>
	rather than sent to a mailing list, though gtk-devel-list
	is an appropriate forum for discussing bug reports once
	they have been entered into bugzilla.
</p>
</UL>
<P><B>Is cross-posting allowed?</B></P>
<UL>
<P>
	Cross-posting between the GTK+ mailing lists should be avoided.
	The partial one exception to this is announcements; see below
	for more details on that.
</P>
</UL>
<P><B>Are job postings OK?</B></P>
<UL>
<P>
	Job postings are allowed on gtk-list and only on
	gtk-list. Other rules about job postings include:
	<ul>
	  <li>Job postings must be directly related to GTK+. Job
	  postings about general X Window System, Linux, or Unix jobs
	  are not acceptable.</li>
	  <li>The subject line should clearly indicate that the mail
	  is a job posting, and should indicate the locality when
	  applicable.</li>
	  <li>Frequent reposting of the same job is not
	  acceptable. While there is no hard-and-fast rule about this,
	  posting the same job more than once every two months is
	  likely too much.</li>
	</ul>
</P>
</UL>
<P><B>Are announcements OK?</B></P>
<UL>
<P>
	Announcements about applications written in GTK+ are not
	on-topic on any of the GTK+ mailing lists. They should
	be sent to gnome-announce-list@gnome.org, the
	<a href="http://www.gnome.org/softwaremap/">GNOME software
	map</a>, or to general forums such as
	<a href="http://freshmeat.net">freshmeat.net</a>.
</P>
<P>
	Announcements of tools and libraries of interest to people
	programming with GTK+, and of binary distributions of GTK+
	are suitable for the GTK+ mailing lists. Wide cross-posting
	is discouraged. Announcements should usually go to gtk-list
	and no more than one other GTK+ mailing list appropriate
	to the subject of the announcement. If you cross-post
	the announcement, please set the Reply-To: header of your
	email to point to a single mailing list.
</P>
