   documentation (using the "<!--PARAMETERS-->" marker).
<li>Handle more variations of C syntax.
</ul>


<h3>GTK-Doc 1.2     (Feb 16 2004)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Added widget signals and properties to undocumented output and statistics.

</ul>


<h3>GTK-Doc 1.1     (Apr 18 2003)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Add a gtk-doc.m4 macro that allows packages to provide consistent
   checking for gtk-doc.
<li>Check to make sure that the XML catalog actually contains entries
   for the DocBook XML DTD and XSLT stylesheets.  Please consult the
   README file if your system's XML catalog isn't set up.
<li>Add infrastructure for including the standard gtk-doc makefile
   glue, so that maintainers of packages don't need to worry about
   keeping it up to date.  See glib head for an example of its use.
<li>Some updates to the devhelp contents file generation, as suggested
   by Hallski.
<li>Fix some bugs in the DocBook XML codepath that were preventing

</ul>
