<P>
<B>General Notes</B>
<UL>
	      <P>
		GTK+ uses so-called "Linux kernel" numbering, where
		odd numbered series like 1.3.x and 2.1.x are unstable
		development versions, and even numbered series like
		2.0.x and 2.2.x are stable maintenance branches.
		It is not expected that we will break either source
		or binary compatibility before GTK+-3.0
	      </P>
	      <P>
		GTK+ development is discussed on
		<a href="/mailinglists.html">gtk-devel-list@gnome.org</a>.
		We use the <a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org">bugzilla</a>
		bug tracker to keep track of particular issues; there
		is a milestone for each future release, as well as a
		'future' milestone, for things not yet assigned to a
		definite milestone. (The components of interest for
		GTK+ development are 'gtk+', 'glib', 'pango' and
		'atk')

<P>
<B>Particular releases</B>
	    <UL>
	      <P><B>2.2</B> &ndash; GTK+-2.2.0 was released Dec 20, 2002. The
		rest of the 2.2.x series will be maintenance releases.
	      </P>
	      <P><a href="/plan/2.4/"><B>2.4</B></a> &ndash; GTK+-2.4 will be a
		release maintaining source and binary compatibility
		with GTK+-2.0 and GTK+-2.2 while introducing new
		features, like a better file selector and
		replacement "combo box" widget.  It is expected that
		2.4 will be out before the end of 2003.
	      </P>
	      <P><B>2.6</B> &ndash; No timescale or feature set for GTK+-2.6 yet exist,
		but it is likely we'll do another release along
		the lines of 2.4 after 2.4.
	      </P>
	      <P><B>3.0</B> &ndash; A 3.0 release would be the earliest point at which
		we would make a source and binary incompatible
		release. (If and when we do such a release, there
		will be support for parallel compilation and
		runtime environments, as there are for GTK+-1.2
		and GTK+-2.x.)
