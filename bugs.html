How to report bugs in GTK+
<!--#include file="section_end.html"-->

<P>
(The following is taken from the <A HREF="/faq/">FAQ</A>.)
</P><P>
Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system (<A HREF="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">http://bugzilla.gnome.org</A>). You will need to enter your email address and receive a password before you can use the system to register a new bug report.
</P><P>
There are a number of options to select and boxes to fill in when submitting a bug report. Please remember that the more information you give, the easier it will be to track the problem down. Extra information that may prove useful includes:
<P>
<I>How to reproduce the bug.</I>
</P>
<UL>
<P>
If you can reproduce it with the testgtk program that is built in the gtk/ subdirectory, that will be most convenient. Otherwise, please include a short test program that exhibits the behavior. As a last resort, you can also provide a pointer to a larger piece of software that can be downloaded.
</P><P>
(Bugs that can be reproduced within the GIMP are almost as good as bugs that can be reproduced in testgtk. If you are reporting a bug found with the GIMP, please include the version number of the GIMP you are using)
</P><P>
</UL>
<P>
<I>If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the crash occurred.</I>
</P><P>
<I>Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but are not necessary.</I> 
<UL>
If you do send a stack trace, and the error is an X error, it will be more useful if the stacktrace is produced running the test program with the --sync command line option.
</UL>

How we use Bugzilla
<!--#include file="section_end.html"-->

<P>
This information below is mostly useful for people who try to work 
on the bugs in Bugzilla.
</P>
<P>
<I>Component</I>
</P>
<UL>
<P>
We are moving towards more fine-grained components, to make the large number
of open bugs more manageable. Some of the more complex widgets have their
own component now, others are grouped together, e.g. the "combobox" component
is used for bugs related to GtkCombo, GtkOptionMenu, GtkEntryCompletion and
GtkComboBox.
</P>
</UL>
<P>
<I>State</I>
</P>
<UL>
<P>
We do not use the UNCONFIRMED state, bugs in the UNCONFIRMED and NEW states
are treated the same. Bugs will generally stay in the NEW state until 
they are either resolved in some way or moved to the NEEDINFO state. The 
NEEDINFO state indicates that additional information from the bug reporter
is needed. The bug reporter is expected to reopen the bug if he provides
the requested information. We occasionally close bugs which have been in 
the NEEDINFO state for a long time (at least 6 months) without any response 
from the bug reporter.
</P>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Priority and Severity</I>
</P>
<UL>
<P>
We generally don't pay much attention to these fields, except for the use
of the Priority field to denote "must fix" bugs for a certain release.
</P>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Milestones</I>
</P>
<UL>
<P>
An unmilestoned bug has not been looked at in depth yet. Milestones of GTK+ 
bugs generally indicate the next version in which the bug <I>can</I> be fixed 
- there is no guarantee that the bug <I>will</I> be fixed in that version.
We use the priority field to distinguish "must fix" bugs for a version. Bugs
with milestone x.y.z and priority High are the ones which we consider 
"must fix" bugs for release x.y.z.
</P>
<P>
In addition to release milestones, we use milestones of the form 
"x.y api freeze" to indicate bugs introduce new API and thus have to be
resolved before the major version x.y is considered API frozen.
</P>
</UL>
<P>
<I>Keywords</I>
</P>
<UL>
<P>
A number of keywords are used regularly with GTK+ bugs, none of them
are used 100% consistently. The more common ones are:
<UL>
<LI><P><B>PATCH</B> a possible patch is attached to the bug. Note that not
  all bugs with attached patches automatically get this keyword. If a patch
  is found unsuitable for some reason, the PATCH keyword is removed.
  The PATCH keyword is no longer needed today, since Bugzilla can query
  for bugs with patches now.
<LI><P><B>easy-fix</B> marks bugs which are considered relatively
  straightforward to fix, so that volunteers have a good chance of producing
  an acceptable fix.
<LI><P><B>PATCH_NEEDED</B> indicates that we need help with this because 
  either we don't care enough to fix it ourselves, or it's something we have 
  no clue about.
<LI><P><B>API</B> bug involves API changes. 
<LI><P><B>string</B> bug involves string changes.
<LI><P><B>keynav</B> bug has something to do with keyboard navigation.
<LI><P><B>accessibility</B> issues like widgets which fail to implement
    accessibility interfaces.
<LI><P><B>portability</B> issues like build failures on certain platforms.
<LI><P><B>multihead</B> marks bugs having to do with the support for
 multiple screens/displays. 
</UL>
</P>
</UL>
