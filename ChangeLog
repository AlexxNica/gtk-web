	* site_top.html: Remove link to Inti project - it's dead.
	* bindings.html: Updated slightly based on feedback on
	language-bindings@gnome.org about progress on GTK+2
	bindings. Corrected some links now that some projects have http
	sites rather than just ftp.

	* index.html

	Add latest release announcements. I will trim the news back down
	once I find a way to make the gtk+-2.0-Changes.html file work.
