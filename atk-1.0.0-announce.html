<pre>ATK-1.0.0 is now available for download from:

 <a href="ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.0/">ftp://ftp.gtk.org/pub/gtk/v2.0/</a>

This is the first stable release of ATK.

The ATK library provides a set of interfaces for accessibility.
By supporting the ATK interfaces, an application or toolkit can
be used with such tools as screen readers, magnifiers,
and alternative input devices.

Atk provides a core set of interfaces which are common to all 
widgets and "additional" interfaces that are appropriate to certain 
classes of widgets and whose existence can be queried at run time. 
It also provides interfaces which an application can use to provide 
additional accessibility information to assistive technology tools.

The GAIL package, available from:
 
 <a href="http://download.gnome.org/GNOME/pre-gnome2/sources/gail/">http://download.gnome.org/GNOME/pre-gnome2/sources/gail/</a>

provides an implementation of the ATK interfaces for the GTK+
user interface toolkit.
