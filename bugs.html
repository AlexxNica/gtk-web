How to report bugs in GTK+
<!--#include file="section_end.html"-->

<p>
(The following is taken from the <A href="/faq/">FAQ</a>.)
</p><p>
Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system 
(<A href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org/">http://bugzilla.gnome.org</a>). You will 
need to enter your email address and receive a password before you can use the 
system to register a new bug report.
</p><p>
There are a number of options to select and boxes to fill in when submitting a 
bug report. Please remember that the more information you give, the easier it 
will be to track the problem down. Extra information that may prove useful includes:
<p>
<I>How to reproduce the bug.</I>
</p>
<ul>
<p>
If you can reproduce it with the testgtk program that is built in the gtk/ 
subdirectory, that will be most convenient. Otherwise, please include a short 
test program that exhibits the behavior. As a last resort, you can also provide 
a pointer to a larger piece of software that can be downloaded.
</p><p>
(Bugs that can be reproduced within the GIMP are almost as good as bugs that can 
be reproduced in testgtk. If you are reporting a bug found with the GIMP, please 
include the version number of the GIMP you are using)
</p><p>
</ul>
<p>
<I>If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the crash 
occurred.</I>
</p><p>
<I>Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but are not necessary.</I> 
<ul>
If you do send a stack trace, and the error is an X error, it will be more useful 
if the stacktrace is produced running the test program with the --sync command 
line option.
</ul>
</p>

How we use Bugzilla
<!--#include file="section_end.html"-->

<p>
This information below is mostly useful for people who try to work 
on the bugs in Bugzilla.
</p>
<p>
<I>Component</I>
</p>
<ul>
<p>
We are moving towards more fine-grained components, to make the large number
of open bugs more manageable. Some of the more complex widgets have their
own component now, others are grouped together, e.g. the "combobox" component
is used for bugs related to GtkCombo, GtkOptionMenu, GtkEntryCompletion and
GtkComboBox.
</p>
</ul>
<p>
<I>State</I>
</p>
<ul>
<p>
We do not use the UNCONFIRMED state, bugs in the UNCONFIRMED and NEW states
are treated the same. Bugs will generally stay in the NEW state until 
they are either resolved in some way or moved to the NEEDINFO state. The 
NEEDINFO state indicates that additional information from the bug reporter
is needed. The bug reporter is expected to reopen the bug if he provides
the requested information. We occasionally close bugs which have been in 
the NEEDINFO state for a long time (at least 6 months) without any response 
from the bug reporter.
</p>
</ul>
<p>
<I>Priority and Severity</I>
</p>
<ul>
<p>
We generally don't pay much attention to these fields, except for the use
of the Priority field to denote "must fix" bugs for a certain release.
</p>
</ul>
<p>
<I>Milestones</I>
</p>
<ul>
<p>
An unmilestoned bug has not been looked at in depth yet. Milestones of GTK+ 
bugs generally indicate the next version in which the bug <I>can</I> be fixed 
- there is no guarantee that the bug <I>will</I> be fixed in that version.
We use the priority field to distinguish "must fix" bugs for a version. Bugs
with milestone x.y.z and priority High are the ones which we consider 
"must fix" bugs for release x.y.z.
</p>
<p>
Starting with the 2.8 development cycle, we will try a new approach to
milestones that is closer to how we work with bugs and will hopefully 
let us avoid moving an ever-growing mountain of bugs from milestone to
milestone.
</p>
<p>
We keep the idea of the 3 "current work" milestones, 
<ul>
 <li><p>2.6.x</p>
 <li><p>2.8 API Freeze</p>
 <li><p>2.8 Freeze</p>
</ul>
but bugs will only go onto one of these milestones if one of the 
following criteria is met:
<ul>
 <li>We couldn't ship the milestone without fixing it
 <li>Someone has signed up to fix the bug before that milestone
</ul>
All other bugs are assigned to a set of "pool milestones". These are 
groups of bugs that are intended to help people figure out what bugs
they should sign up to fix for a milestone.
</p>
<p>
Here is a list of our current pool milestones:
<dl>
 <dt>Need diagnosis
 <dd><p>A reported bug that the maintainers of GTK+ can't commit to fixing
     because they don't know what is going: there are no reproduction 
     instructions or it occurs on a platform that they don't have acess
     to. This is different from NEEDINFO because NEEDINFO should mean
     that the bug is waiting for specific information from the reporter.</p>
 <dt>Small fix
 <dd><p>A small bug with a diagnosis that needs code written to 
     fix the bug (few minutes to a few hours)</p>
 <dt>Medium fix
 <dd><p>A reported bug with a diagnosis that needs code written to 
     fix the bug (few hours to a week)</p>
 <dt>Small feature
 <dd><p>Small feature additions; no new API (few minutes to a few hours)</p>
 <dt>Medium feature
 <dd><p>Medium feature additions; no new API (few hours to a week)</p>
 <dt>Big feature
 <dd><p>Big feature additions; no new API (1 week to 1 year)</p>
 <dt>Small API
 <dd><p>Small API additions (few minutes to a few hours)</p>
 <dt>Medium API
 <dd><p>Medium API additions (few hours to a week)</p>
 <dt>Big API
 <dd><p>Big API additions (1 week to 1 year)</p>
 </dl>
</p>
</ul>
<p>
<I>Keywords</I>
</p>
<ul>
<p>
A number of keywords are used regularly with GTK+ bugs, none of them
are used 100% consistently. The more common ones are:
<ul>
<LI><p><b>PATCH</b> a possible patch is attached to the bug. Note that not
  all bugs with attached patches automatically get this keyword. If a patch
  is found unsuitable for some reason, the PATCH keyword is removed.
  The PATCH keyword is no longer needed today, since Bugzilla can query
  for bugs with patches now.
<LI><p><b>easy-fix</b> marks bugs which are considered relatively
  straightforward to fix, so that volunteers have a good chance of producing
  an acceptable fix.
<LI><p><b>PATCH_NEEDED</b> indicates that we need help with this because 
  either we don't care enough to fix it ourselves, or it's something we have 
  no clue about.
<LI><p><b>API</b> bug involves API changes. 
<LI><p><b>string</b> bug involves string changes.
<LI><p><b>keynav</b> bug has something to do with keyboard navigation.
<LI><p><b>accessibility</b> issues like widgets which fail to implement
    accessibility interfaces.
<LI><p><b>portability</b> issues like build failures on certain platforms.
<LI><p><b>multihead</b> marks bugs having to do with the support for
 multiple screens/displays. 
</ul>
</p>
</ul>
