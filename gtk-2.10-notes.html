<pre>GTK+ 2.10 Specific Notes
========================

* The hexadecimal Unicode input feature has been reworked. It no longer
  blocks the use of the sixteen Ctrl-Shift-&lt;hex digit&gt; key sequences. Now
  it only uses Ctrl-Shift-u.

* A memory leak in GtkStyle handling has been fixed. This may expose bugs
  in third-party widgets which forget to call gtk_style_attach() in their
  realize functions.

* Range widgets like GtkScrollbar now render their arrows insensitive
  when the slider is at the end. Applications which react to arrow
  clicks even if the slider is at the end may want to use the new
  gtk_range_set_[upper/lower]_stepper_sensitivity() functions to
  prevent the arrows from being rendered insensitive.

* GtkObject now uses the "floating reference" support in GObject. 
  GTK_OBJECT_IS_FLOATING() will still work, but direct checking
  of the GTK_FLOATING flag will no longer detect the floating 
  reference. Details about floating references can be found in the docs:
  <a href="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gobject/gobject-The-Base-Object-Type.html#floating-ref">http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/gobject/gobject-The-Base-Object-Type.html#floating-ref</a>

* Accelerators like (_F) are now stripped from labels when they are 
  displayed in toolbars. If this is not wanted, the feature can be 
  suppressed by inserting a Unicode control character, e.g ZWNJ.

* The pixbuf theme engine can now customize expanders (in GtkTreeView
  and GtkExpander) and resize grips, using the new EXPANDER and
  RESIZE_GRIP function values.

* Dialogs created by gtk_about_dialog_new() no longer hide automatically
  when the user clicks close. It is the applications responsibility to
  hide or destroy the dialog.

* Several new signals have been added to GtkNotebook. Care has been taken
  to choose signal names which do not collide with signals added by well-known
  derived classes. The names which can no longer be used for signals in 
  objects derived from GtkNotebook are page-reordered, page-removed and
  page-added.

* Due to the interface changes in the file chooser backend interface, 
  the GTK+ ABI version has been bumped to 2.10.0. Third-party filesystem 
  backends have to be ported to the new interface, other modules, such as 
  theme engines, input method modules or pixbuf loaders have to be rebuilt 
  so that they are installed in the right place for GTK+ to find them.

How to report bugs
==================

Bugs should be reported to the GNOME bug tracking system.
(<a href="http://bugzilla.gnome.org">http://bugzilla.gnome.org</a>, product gtk+.) You will need to create an
account for yourself.
  
In the bug report please include:
  
* Information about your system. For instance:

   - What operating system and version
   - What version of X
   - For Linux, what version of the C library

  And anything else you think is relevant.

* How to reproduce the bug. 

  If you can reproduce it with the testgtk program that is built in the
  gtk/ subdirectory, that will be most convenient.  Otherwise, please
  include a short test program that exhibits the behavior.  As a last
  resort, you can also provide a pointer to a larger piece of software
  that can be downloaded.

* If the bug was a crash, the exact text that was printed out when the
  crash occured.

* Further information such as stack traces may be useful, but is not
  necessary. If you do send a stack trace, and the error is an X error,
  it will be more useful if the stacktrace is produced running the test
  program with the --sync command line option.

Patches
=======

Patches should also be submitted to bugzilla.gnome.org. If the patch
fixes an existing bug, add the patch as an attachment to that bug
report.

Otherwise, enter a new bug report that describes the patch, and attach
the patch to that bug report.

Bug reports containing patches should include the PATCH keyword in their
keyword fields. If the patch adds to or changes the GTK programming
interface, the API keyword should also be included.
  
Patches should be in unified diff form. (The -u option to GNU diff.)
