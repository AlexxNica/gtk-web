<p>
The news listed on the <A HREF="/news">news page</A> is provided to us by 
<a href="http://www.freshmeat.net/">freshmeat.net</a>.  
We do not have a good way to provide news which is not on freshmeat.
</p>
<p>
What that means is that if you want application news to show up here, go add 
it to freshmeat via the 
<A HREF="http://core.freshmeat.net/contrib.php3">freshmeat 
contribution page</A>.  Then e-mail 
<A HREF="mailto:newapp@gtk.org">newapp@gtk.org</a> once the application news 
shows up at freshmeat and we will set a flag so the app is shown on our page.
</p>
<p>
We get freshmeat news slightly after it appears on freshmeat, but it should 
be pretty quick most the time.  (Within 24 hours definately.)
